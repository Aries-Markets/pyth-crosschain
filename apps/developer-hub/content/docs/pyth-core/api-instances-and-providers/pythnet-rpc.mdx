# Pythnet RPC

You will need a Pythnet RPC to run Hermes, which you can obtain from any of the Pythnet RPC
providers below:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/)
- [Figment](https://figment.io)

Alternatively, you can host Pythnet RPC yourself, but this is discouraged due to the potential high cost and maintenance
involved in operating it. If you still wish to run it, please contact the Pyth team for more information.
